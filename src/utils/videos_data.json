    "description": "Buy AumSum Merchandise: https://www.aumsum.com\n\nWhy does our Foot Fall Asleep?\nMany people believe that when our foot falls asleep, basically the blood supply has been cut to our foot. \nBut the real answer is that it has to do more with our nerves as compared to our blood. Nerves are like cables which run through our entire body.\nTheir main function is to carry electrical impulses or messages between our brain and our body.\nNow, when we sit on our foot, the nerves in that area are temporarily compressed. \nHence, these nerves are not able to send any message to our brain or receive any message from our brain. As a result, the connection between our brain and our foot is cut off. \nHence, it feels like our foot has fallen asleep.\n\nReference:\nhttps://kidshealth.org/en/kids/foot-asleep.html\n\nTimecodes\n0:00 - Why does our Foot Fall Asleep?\n1:14 - Why does salt make food taste better?\n2:26 - Why do our muscles get sore?",

In this episode, we'll learn about the big timescales involved in dinosaur evolution/extinction with the use of a gigantic scale timeline. We'll learn about the sizes of various dinosaurs including Tyrannosaurus rex, Triceratops, Brachiosaurus, Velociraptor and Deinonychus, and how they compare to large modern vehicles, as well as a bunch of interesting facts about T-Rex and Triceratops.\n\nThis is one of the most complex and dare I say best looking animations I've created to date and it took me over 2.5 months of long days and late nights to produce.

    "description": "Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Zach Lahn discuss the Wonder School, a Socratic-based education system in Wichita, Kansas. They delve into the value of learner-driven education, the origins of the American school system as a means to create obedient factory workers, and the true role of schools in shaping a child‚Äôs character. They also walk through a day in the life of a Wonder Leaner, the curriculum designed to help inspire these students toward their true calling, and exactly why this unconventional approach might be well worth your consideration as a parent.\n\nZach Lahn is the co-founder of Wonder, a learner-driven school in Wichita, Kansas, with the mission of helping young people find their calling and preparing them to change the world. His background in business has been as a founder of a search fund focused on acquiring and building small to medium companies. Prior to founding Wonder, Zach managed U.S. Congressional and Senatorial campaigns and raised funds for startup companies and nonprofit organizations. He now spends nearly all of his time at school with his six kids and with his wife, building a regenerative farm on his family‚Äôs ancestral homestead in Iowa.\n\nDr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://bit.ly/3KrWbS8\n\nEp.370\n\n\n- Sponsor - \n\nPre-born: ‚Äã‚ÄãHelp save 11,000 babies from abortion: https://preborn.com/Jordan\n\n\n- Links -\n\nFor Zach Lahn:\n\nTwitter @ZachLahn https://twitter.com/ZachLahn \n\nThe Wonder School www.daringtowonder.com/\n\n\n- Chapters -\n\n(0:00) Coming up\n(0:27) Intro\n(1:15) The need for a new model\n(5:46) What is most important for children to learn?\n(6:57) Agency over skillset\n(9:45) Self Authoring\n(12:43) Origin of the American education system\n(15:44) competing systems\n(17:36) The Wonder schedule\n(21:28) Kids live in a meta narrative\n(22:23) The education of character\n(23:47) Akira the Don, active learning\n(27:36) Mixed age classes\n(30:20) Inspiring development and leadership\n(31:31) Necessary freedom\n(33:07) Socratic discussion, mentors\n(37:05) Khan Academy\n(39:20) Goals for kindergarten\n(40:04) Compared to public school\n(41:51) Tuition\n(43:20) The problem with measurement\n(44:30) Self tracking and public peer review\n(50:00) Two behaviors that cannot work in school\n(51:26) If not rectified by the age of 4‚Ä¶\n(52:49) Gamified learning\n(54:03) Freedom hours\n(56:49) Are Wonder graduates prepared?\n(58:14) How conflicts are handled\n(1:01:13) All learning is self-learning\n(1:04:25) When initiative is scorned\n(1:07:54) How to determine what learners read\n(1:09:18) Why self help books are so useful\n(1:10:34) Why children don‚Äôt like reading\n(1:12:17) Book review review\n(1:15:09) Badge plan\n(1:19:10) Aims of each age group\n(1:22:18) The power in apprenticeships\n(1:28:50) Approach to high school, the ‚Äúnext great adventure‚Äù\n(1:32:05) Success of the model\n(1:34:03) Be ready for a journey\n\n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\nNewsletter: https://mailchi.mp/jordanbpeterson.com/youtubesignup\nDonations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning\n\n// LINKS //\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog\n\n// SOCIAL //\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\nTelegram: https://t.me/DrJordanPeterson\nAll socials: https://linktr.ee/drjordanbpeterson\n\n#JordanPeterson #JordanBPeterson #DrJordanPeterson #DrJordanBPeterson #DailyWirePlus",

A kid has to convince his parents to allow him to do something like becoming a YouTuber, Graphic Designer, Video Editor, etc. But why the situation is like this?

    "description": "In this video, we delve into the reasons why India's education system is failing. We explore the historical context of its establishment, the success it achieved in the past, and how it is currently unable to meet the demands of a changing world. The video emphasizes the need for specialization and suggests alternative approaches to acquiring in-depth skills for career success. Discover why self-improvement and becoming a specialist might be the key to overcoming the shortcomings of the education system and building a successful career in today's competitive world.\n\n#indianeducationsystem #specializationmatters #tanaypratap \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLike, Share, and Subscribe for more!\n\nFollow me on my other social media handles for all updates, events, and live sessions-\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/tanaypratap/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/tanayofficial\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanaypratap/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/tanaypratap\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat's my story? An engineer, in love with his job, started teaching on the side. Got lucky. Impacted 1000s of lives. Had to finally leave his job to increase the impact surface area. Raised $5M funding to fix education. Is learning day and day about startups and building a valuable product. \n\nHow is it going? A decade of engineering helps in systems thinking and product building. Learning about Strategy, Marketing, People Management, and Finance on the go. \n\nWhat am I building? Today, 25 million Indians prepare for government job entrance exams. They do it for years together. The probability of success is less than 1% but they still do it. Why? For the lack of a structured alternative to launch their white-collar career. I am building Invact to bridge this gap. \nHow? Follow me to know, it's a long story. I am telling it in parts every day.",
