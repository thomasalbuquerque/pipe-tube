Cuquin is a 3D animated cartoon with which the youngest members of the family can learn and laugh. The protagonist of the cartoon series \"\"Cleo and Cuquin\"\" is a tireless, unpredictable, clever, agile and very playful baby. He is a small battery full of infinite energy. He still doesn't walk and barely speaks, he still babbles in his own language: a mixture of baby talk and nursery rhymes, but that's not going to stop him from getting everything he wants!\n\nCuquin is never bored because he can turn anything into a fun game or toy. In this channel you can learn letters, colors, shapes and much more! Sing and dance to the Telerin Family's nursery rhymes. Now you can enjoy the best educational and music videos for the whole family. \n\n‚Ä¢ WEB: http://www.cleocuquin.com/en\n‚Ä¢ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/cleoandcuquin\n‚Ä¢ Tik Tok: https://www.tiktok.com/@cuquin_telerin?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc\n‚Ä¢ Twitter: https://twitter.com/CleoandCuquin\n‚Ä¢ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/cleoandcuquin_english\n\n-Cuquin en espa√±ol: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHB-MJJYuDt3hYABh1eobKQ?sub_confirmation=1\n-Cuquin em portugu√™s: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgj8mspgMoUlsX2MvCouDZQ/featured?sub_confirmation=1\n\n-Cleo & Cuquin in English: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmtjprMoWchupVQURe1nfhQ?sub_confirmation=1\n-Cleo y Cuquin en espa√±ol: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChlTeveFUK6bvHrmCb8J99w?sub_confirmation=1\n-Cleo & Cuquin em Portugu√™s: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYzfXFXFBTdvmt9u4ipUqrQ?sub_confirmation=1\n-–ö–ª–µ–æ –∏ –¥—Ä—É–∑—å—è. –í—Å–µ —Å–µ—Ä–∏–∏ –ø–æ–¥—Ä—è–¥: http://bit.ly/2DzfMfU\n\nDibujos animados, caricaturas animadas, animation, animaci√≥n, cartoon, tv show, anima√ß√£o, desenhos animados,  –º—É–ª—å—Ç—Ñ–∏–ª—å–º –¥–ª—è –¥–µ—Ç–µ–π, desene animate pentru copii, cartone animato per bambini, cartoon voor kinderen, sarimihetsika ho an'ny ankizy, √ßocuklar i√ßin √ßizgi film\n\n#cartoon #kids #forkids",
